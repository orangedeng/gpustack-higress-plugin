// defaultEnabled: installing this CR already means you want it, so it defaults
// to on.
//
// Turning it off for one route can be written two ways, depending on which
// shape you want:
//
//	on globally, off for a few:  defaultConfig: {}              + enabled: false in the matchRule
//	off globally, on for a few:  defaultConfig: {enabled:false} + enabled: true  in the matchRule
//
// The latter can also be had with defaultConfigDisable: true on the CR, but
// that is a **deployment-level** switch (the plugin does not run at all on
// routes not listed in matchRules) whereas enabled is a **config-level** one --
// a single matchRule can list many ingresses, and flipping one boolean reviews
// more easily than adding and removing entries. The two stack; either one off
// means off.
const defaultEnabled = true

// defaultWeight: this entry's vote multiplier, 1 by default.
//
// After the finisher's L1 normalisation every entry casts a total of one vote,
// and weight is the multiplier on it. 0 is not a meaningful value ("do not
// participate" is expressed with enabled), so this is a bare float64 rather
// than a pointer (§9 rule 5).
const defaultWeight = 1.0

// Config has just one switch and one weight.
//
// **The scoring function itself has no parameters at all.** That is a
// conclusion, not a gap -- going through the things one might want to
// configure, every one of them has a better home:
//
//	what counts as "load"   Inflight + Penalty is a definition, not a preference;
//	                        a knob here would just permit a wrong definition
//	penalty decay window    lives in the finisher (rampMs), which is the writer
//	                        that does the ejecting
//	capacity ceiling        lives on the candidate (maxRunningRequests); that is
//	                        a topology fact
//	tie handling            random, to avoid a thundering herd; a correctness
//	                        requirement, not a matter of taste
//	the scoring transform   it carries meaning (see score.go) and should not be
//	                        changed from config -- to tune "how much say this
//	                        entry has", use weight, which is the knob designed
//	                        for exactly that
//
// So this plugin is a pure function of the published candidate set, and weight
// only affects its share of the finisher's weighted sum, not the function
// itself.

// be a pointer: a zero-valued global has enabled == nil rather than false, the
// nil is inherited as-is, and the reader treats it as the default true. With a
// bare bool, one unrelated typo in the global config would silently turn load
// awareness off on **every route** -- degrading to round-robin with no error
// anywhere, only the kind of "hmm, this looks unbalanced" symptom you notice
// long after the fact.
//
// There is no wholesale `*config = global` copy here; every rule is parsed from
// scratch and only enabled is copied across. Config has just that one field, so
